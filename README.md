# Pomodoro Clock

Part of the Odin Project [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-and-css-basics).
Uses Javascript (and JQuery), HTML, and CSS to build a Pomodoro clock. The Pomodoro technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
